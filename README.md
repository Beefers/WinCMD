# WinCMD is deprecated.

## Huh?
I decided to deprecate this project due to how much of a mess the code was. It's 521 lines, and yet, in my newest project, ZMD, I've already achieved the same goal as WinCMD in around 50 lines, in the main file.

## Don't fret, however!
As I mentioned above, I've started work upon a project that, while similar to WinCMD, uses multiple files. It's in very early stages, and I'd appreciate any and all feedback. If you want something added, don't hesitate to leave a pull request, and I'll review them ASAP! ZMD can be found (here)[https://github.com/Beefers/zmd]

# WinCMD, an open-source command line for Windows.
## Changelog

### Version 1.1r
* Added Themes and ShellStyle! Found within the settings command, which also allows you to change many other options.
* Rewrote/reorganised the command handler to allow for ShellStyle and Themes, and to make it easier to work with.
* Optimised load time, and cleaned up the file.
* Other general fixes to functionality and to comments.
### Sneak Peek
Next update, more overhauls will come to crucial parts of WinCMD, such as the Error Handler. There will also be ways to install WinCMD to system32, and potentially, plugins!
The update should arrive any time this week, with betas being released regularly.
~~wow i sure do wish this was still happening~~
