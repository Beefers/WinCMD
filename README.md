## Changelog

### Changelog

* Optimised load time, and cleaned up the file.
* Other general fixes to functionality and to comments.
### Sneak Peek
Next update, more overhauls will come to crucial parts of WinCMD, such as the Error Handler. There will also be ways to install WinCMD to system32, and potentially, plugins!
The update should arrive any time this week, with betas being released regularly.

~~Important!
WinCMD will be recieving a full re-write soon.

~~Why are you re-writing! It's barely even released!
Ultimately, it is because WinCMD's very base was built from code I created in 2015. It has many errors that I have no idea how to fix, and this is why I'll be rewriting the whole program.

~~Okay, will there be any setbacks to re-writing?
Initially, yes. Due to the nature of re-writes, some commands will be missing whilst they are updated to whatever new command handler and etc I end up creating. Some functionality may also be removed, hopefully temporarily.

~~When will the re-written version be available?
I have no idea.
