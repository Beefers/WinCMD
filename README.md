# WinCMD, an open-source command line for Windows.

__## Important!__
### WinCMD will be recieving a full re-write soon.

### Why are you re-writing! It's barely even released!
Ultimately, it is because WinCMD's very base was built from code I created in 2015. It has many errors that I have no idea how to fix, and this is why I'll be rewriting the whole program.

### Okay, will there be any setbacks to re-writing?
Initially, yes. Due to the nature of re-writes, some commands will be missing whilst they are updated to whatever new command handler and etc I end up creating. Some functionality may also be removed, hopefully temporarily.

### When will the re-written version be available?
I have no idea.
